**Output:**
- Model Coefficients
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Actual vs Predicted plot  

**Problem 2: Body Weight Prediction**  
Predicts body weight using:
- Height
- Age
- Gender  

**Output:**
- Predicted Weight for Sample Input
- Actual vs Predicted comparison plot

### 📌 Lab-2: Logistic Regression
**Problem: Diabetes Prediction**  
Predicts if a person is diabetic based on:
- Pregnancies  
- Glucose Level  
- Blood Pressure  
- BMI, Age, and Other Features  

**Output:**
- Confusion Matrix  
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
- ROC Curve  

---

### 📌 Lab-3: Decision Tree Classifier
**Problem: Play Tennis Prediction**  
Predicts whether a person will play tennis based on:
- Weather (Sunny, Rainy, Overcast)
- Humidity
- Wind  

**Output:**
- Trained Decision Tree Visualization
- Classification Report
- Accuracy Score  

---

### 📌 Lab-4: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
**Problem 1: Quadratic Dataset Classification**  
- Generates a random dataset with a non-linear distribution  
- Trains SVM with RBF kernel  
- Plots Decision Boundary  

**Problem 2: Spam Classification**  
Classifies email as spam or not spam based on:
- Word Frequency
- Message Length  

**Output:**
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1)
